### 🏃 3. Run the development server
npm run dev
The app will be available at: http://localhost:5173


## 🔗 Connecting to Backend (PHP API)
The backend for ODIMS is built using PHP and should be cloned and placed in your server root (e.g. htdocs for XAMPP).

Backend Repository: https://github.com/your-username/odims-backend

### 📁 1. Clone backend repo
⚠️ Important:
Make sure you have folder path like below in the htdocs folder:
"C:\xampp\htdocs\projects_and_practices\projects\OBN_project"

cd C:\xampp\htdocs\projects_and_practices\projects\OBN_project
git clone https://github.com/dago-o/OBN-DIMS-backend-.git

### 2. Setup database

Create a MySQL database (e.g. obn_dims)

Import the provided .sql file into phpMyAdmin

Update the database credentials in your backend PHP files (connection.php or config.php)

### 3. Start Apache and MySQL (XAMPP)

Ensure XAMPP (or your server) is running so that the frontend can send requests to the backend.
